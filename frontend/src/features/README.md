# Frontend Structure

We follow the directory structure of building 'features' which are the main components of the application.

Each feature has its own directory with the following structure:

- `components`: Contains the UI components for the feature.
- `types`: Contains the types for the feature.
- `utils`: Contains the utility functions for the feature.
- `pages`: Contains the pages for the feature.
- `store`: Contains the Zustand store for the feature.

Each feature is independent and can be developed and tested independently.
